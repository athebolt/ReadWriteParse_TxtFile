Program 01

What it does:
This program is a menu with 6 options that display details about employees and departments.
The information is provided from a text file which can be switched for a different text file.
Each option carries out its task successfully. Nothing is incomplete or broken in this program.

How I did it:
Most of the text file parsing code I copied and changed the variables of. I put every option into
a function along with the menu display and menu options. I worked on each option down the line
starting from option 1 and skipping 4 to do last. The 4th option was the hardest of them all by far.
The other options and the rest of the code took about an hour while working on option 4 alone took
around 2 hours of brainstorming and testing. I figured out a way to get it to work with just 2 departments,
but if there was a third department in building A then it would break. I wanted to use a vector, but I wasn't
sure how to use one until next class. Then option 4 took about a half hour of work to finish. This program
wasn't that hard and I am looking forward to doing this without a vector.
